# tooling-bootstrap-module3
  This is the online-version: https://even-shame.surge.sh/dist/index.html
  
    when i open the link some pictures don't show up and i don't know why.
    when i open the live server in VS code everything looks fine, so I don't know 
    whats wrong with the surge link.. 
    
    1. The slides dont work, I followed the code on how to do that on w3schools but i'm 
    obviously doing something wrong which i am not noticing right know (tired brain)
    
    2. I didn't do any CSS because lack of time, so I want to develop and work more on this website when 
    i have more free-time:)
